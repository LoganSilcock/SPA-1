			<h1>What's Under Your Wheels?</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4><strong>Wellington has a huge range of side walks, pavements and paths.</strong> From stone 
		slabs outside the war memorial to pot holes... anywhere you walk, or skate, there's always 
		something different to ride on.</h4>

		<p>Seeing as I use a skateboard to get around a little bit as it is so much faster than walking 
		and I have noticed that some paths are easier to ride on then others and little potholes and 
		such to look out for.<br /><br /></p>

				<h3>Classic Concrete</h3>
				<p>Standard footpaths outside of the CBD. You'll find theses pathways everywhere 
				providing a smooth and gentle surface for skateboarders however can be filled with 
				potholes or patches so watch out!</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Zig-Zag Bricks</h3>
				<p>Common footpath in the middle of Wellington City. These paths can be great to 
				ride on or the loudest most annoying to ride on depending on the angle that you're 
				going.
				<br /><br />
				If you're skating diagonally across it's quiet and very smooth however when you 
				skate along these bricks straight, the shaking is something incredible and the noise is 
				something atrocious.

				<h3>Shipping Containers?</h3>
				<p>Due to plenty of work happening around Wellington, shippping containers are used 
				to let pedestrians walk saftely around. These however are not the best to be skating 
				on. Loud and also very dangerous as the metal can stop them wheels pronto and send 
				you flying.</p>

				<h3>Parks</h3>
				<p>Wellington is full of parks and fun little grass areas to take a break from the 
				rest of the concrete jungle. These are not really reccomended to skate along as you'll 
				probably fall off but its always nice to take a break and walk for a bit!</p>

				<h3>Good hOle' Pothole Cover</h3>
				<p>These things can be quite dodgy as the skateboard wheels can get locked up in the 
				smaller ruts in them. 
				<br /><br />
				They can sometimes be quite interesting and have rather cool designs on it however 
				while making it look prettier, it makes it rougher to ride across. </p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Trees?</h3>
				<p>Probably best to steer around these as they're not known for moving out of the way. 
				Mainly through part of the CBD, these pesky oxygen producing nature things pop up quite 
				often. Best keep an eye out for them!</p>

				<h3>Those Pesky Cars</h3>
				<p>Traffic is a pain and can really get in the way of your skateboarding but no fear! 
				There are these pedestrian islands right in the middle of the road for you to be safe in.
				However there are these silly speed bumps (or Tactile Surfacing Patterns if you want 
				to get technical) so to be honest its probably just best to get off and walk over 
				the road.</p>

			I was trying to make a fixed position footer in here however I was

		<h3>Grids</h3>

		<p>Use grids to divide up or layout content. For example, putting an image on the left, and lots to text on the right</p>

		<p>I've added a 'show' class so you can see where the grids are. Use chrome's web inspector tools to take a closer look</p>


		<div class="g-row show"> 
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>

			<div class="g-30 show">
				30% width .g-30
			</div>

			<div class="g-70 show">
				70% width .g-70
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>The other cool things about grids, is that 50% width means 50% of the div's <em>parent</em>. 
		This means you can put cells in cells to get infinitly smaller sizes. The possiblities are endless!</p>

		<div class="g-row show">
			<div class="g-50 show">
				<div class="g-50 show">
					<div class="g-50 show">
						50%
					</div>
					<div class="g-50 show">
						50%
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="g-50 show">
					50%
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50%
